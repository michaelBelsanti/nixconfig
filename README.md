My systems and user configurations in a Nix Flake

This flake is designed using [Denix](https://yunfachi.github.io/denix/).

Note: Some of the files in this repo are encrypted using git-crypt, which unfortunately will prevent the flake from evaulating when they are encrypted. To fix this, simply remove hosts/nyx and modules/private before evaluating.
